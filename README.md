# Team-NOOBS-Cascade-Cup-2022-
My work done for **Cascade Cup 2022**, a Data Science Competition organized by the **Consulting and Analytics Club of IIT Guwahati**. This competition spanning 3 weeks consisted of a qualifying data science quiz round followed by an ML Hackathon round. Out of nearly 200 teams in round 2, 30 teams got selected for round 3 which was a data analysis report round involving Exploratory Data Analysis on the given datasets. Both round 2 and 3 had equal weightage in determining the final result. I secured 2nd position overall and 3rd position in the hackathon round. This was a great learning experience for me as this was my first data science hackathon. I learned a lot while tackling all the challenges I faced and the time I spent on this competition was well worth it.

My **Kaggle Notebook** for the hackathon with short descriptions of my approach and my luck in terms of feature engineering: https://www.kaggle.com/varunnagpalspyz/rank-3-model-stacking-op-feature-eng

The **Data Analysis** round was a very new experience for me and I felt I could have been a lot more creative with my approach. I tried to do as well as possible in executing my simple approach of univariate and bivariate analysis along with short descriptions of my data cleaning and feature enineering steps.
